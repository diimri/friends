# Friends Database

Technolgy used for the project is Ruby on Rails.

Three main componenet of the project:
  1. Model 
  2. Controller
  3. View

At first I need to create all the database attributes that I am going to use by 'Scaffold' or migrations This could be anything friends,post etc.

When we create attributes of datatbase to commit those changes we need to once migrate all of it.

Now we are having  model , view and controller of it created. 
* Model helps to map the relation (in broader term)
* Controller lets me control the functions of the attributes such as Visibility(backend)
* Views shows us what a user sees (frontend)


**Controller**
Here most of the work is in Friends controller which is responsible for all the CRUD operations.


**Model**
here the mapping is done between the users and friends

**View**
This is responsible to show us the interface
