# Friends Database

Technolgy used for the project is Ruby on Rails .
Three main componenet of the project  1Model 2Controller 3View
At first I need to create all the database attributes that I am going to use by 'Scaffold' or migrations This could be anything friends,post etc.
When we create attributes of datatbase to commit those changes we need to once migrate all of it .
Now we are having  model , view and controller of it created .
model helps to map the relation (in broader term)
controller lets me control the functions of the attributes such as Visibility(backend)
Then the views shows us what a user sees (frontend)
